abstract: |
  An innovative approach to processing ISO20022 financial messages using multiple
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. The system combines Simple RAG,
  Context-Enriched RAG, and Reranker RAG with an adaptive weighting mechanism to
  provide accurate, compliant, and context-aware processing of financial messages.
  
  Key features include:
  - Adaptive Multi-RAG Architecture
  - Financial Domain-Specific Evaluation
  - Business-Technical Bridge
  - Compliance-Aware Processing
  - Dynamic Query Handling
